    1. the ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
    2. 5% goes to the creator.
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
    1. And this will be done programmatically
3. Using chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation
    1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
